## Linguistics in Dice

Once the installation (instructions below) is complete, see [`examples/linguistics/tour.jl`](examples/linguistics/tour.jl) for a quick start to Dice.jl.

The following linguistics-related programs are included. The expected output of each is in a comment at the bottom of the file.
- Probabilistic state machine ([`examples/linguistics/state_machine.jl`](examples/linguistics/state_machine.jl))
  - A finite automata where nodes can have multiple outgoing edges labeled with the same symbol. Each edge is annotated with the probability it is taken when multiple are possible.
- Probabilistic grammar ([`examples/linguistics/grammar.jl`](examples/linguistics/grammar.jl))
  - A context-free grammar where rules are annotated with the probability that its LHS nonterminal will expand to it.
  - The program then models the distribution of sentences when nonterminals are continuously expanded from an initial sentence only containing the start symbol...
  - ... given the final sentence starts with a particular prefix.
- Probabilistic parse ([`examples/linguistics/parser.jl`](examples/linguistics/parser.jl))
  - Given a sentence, find the distribution over possible parse trees, assuming the sentence was generated by the above process

Beware that the programs expected to run on this version of Dice.jl are the examples listed above and the tests. Other examples are known to be broken.

## Installation

Install Julia 1.7 or higher using [these instructions](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/).

Clone the git repository:
```bash
git clone -b grammar_global_mgr https://github.com/Juice-jl/Dice.jl.git
```

Start julia in project mode for current folder:
```bash
cd Dice.jl
julia --project
```

Install Dice and update dependencies (one can also use `precompile` or `build`):

```julia
] up
```

Press CTRL-C or backspace to exit from the pkg terminal and return to Julia REPL.

One can now run a program from the Julia REPL:
```julia
include("examples/lingustics/grammar.jl")
```

Or from the command line:
```julia
julia --project examples/linguistics/grammar.jl
```
